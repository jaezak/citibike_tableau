### Background

![Citi-Bikes](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m18/lms/img/citi-bike-station-bikes.jpg)

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

### Files

You will be selecting files to download from the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) source, as described in the following instructions.

> **Note:** Do not download every zip file available, as combining this much data will cause issues in Tableau. 1-3 zip files should be sufficient to meet the challenge requirements. Tableau restricts data file size to 1GB.
>
> Note also that the data structure has changed over time, so it may be simpler for you to select data that uses the same columns across multiple files, preferably from within the past year.

    * The following are questions you may wish to answer. Do not limit yourself to these questions; they are suggestions for a starting point. Be creative!

      * How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?

      * By what percentage has total ridership grown?

      * How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

      * What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?

      * What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?

      * Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?

      * Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?

      * Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why?

      * Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?

      * How does the average trip duration change by the type of user? (This may be under "User Type" or "member_casual" depending on the period the data is from).

      * What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?

      * Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

      * How variable is the utilization by bike ID?


Create one of the following visualizations for city officials:

    * **Basic:** A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.

    * **Advanced:** A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.

    * The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during your analysis.

Final Presentation
    A Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
